Amethysts Analysis

Starfruit Analysis
Remy Buy High and sells low
Valentina sells high and buys low
other traders are not very frequent
two potential strategies: meet remy at his buy and sell prices, undercut Valentina an their sell and buy prices
both failed, even with linear regression predictions, low yield product, move to baskets or coconuts

for nontraded assests, look for signal traders
